          <h2>Correlations Discovered Between Age and Smokers Percentage</h2>
          <p>Cigarette smoking remains the leading cause of preventable disease, disability, and death in the United States, 
             accounting for more than 480,000 deaths every year, or about 1 in 5 deaths. An estimated of 34.1 million adults in
             the United States currently smoke cigarettes. More than 16 million Americans live with a smoking-related disease.</p>

          <p>On the plot above, although a clear concentration of smokers locate at the 36-40 years old mark, there seems not 
             to be a strong correlation between the median age of population and the smokers ratio across the US. We can say that
             smokers percentage depends stongly on state regulations. For example, West Virginia (WV), which donesn't 
             have enacted any general statewide ban on smoking in workplaces and bars/resturants, has the higher smoker %.</p>

          <p>On the contrary, in Utah were smoking laws and bans in place are stricter than in other states, the smoker % goes way down.
             By watching the median age across all the US states, we can conclude that smoking habits might have also
             something to do with generational behaviors and trends. With the pass of time, the smokers % should go down.</p>
